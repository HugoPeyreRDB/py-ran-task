## Running the test

In order run the test, you have to download the test program `py-ran-task.py` and then it will work out of the box if you save the `config_spanish.py`  in the folder `Spanish-lettersnumbers`. You can also edit the file `py-ran-task.py` and change:

    config_file="./Spanish-lettersnumbers/config_spanish.py"

to wherever you have saved the configuration file. The results file will be `resultsRAN.txt` and will be saved in the folder `dataRAN` (by default), but this can also be changed in `py-ran-task.py`:

    results_file = "resultsRAN.txt"
    data_path = "dataRAN"
    
To run the script open the terminal (or command line interface) and enter:

    python py-ran-task.py
