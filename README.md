Py-RAN-Task
===========

The script is basically an adapation (or hack) of a Python program created by Titus Von der Malsburg (originally for the [operation span task](https://github.com/tmalsburg/py-span-task)). Py-RAN-Task can be used for testing the Rapid Automatized Naming task on a computer with Python (and tkSnack for recording the audio).
